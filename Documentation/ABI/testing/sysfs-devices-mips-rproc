Description:
		CPU topology file describing which CPUs may be used by the
		MIPS remote processor driver when offline from Linux.

		This can be read to observe the current setting, or written to
		change the allowed CPUs.

		The format is compatible with cpulist_parse()
		[see <linux/cpumask.h>], for example to enable the MIPS remote
		processor driver on CPUs 1,2 & 3, write "1-3" into this file.
